# WordSorter
# Written by David BRuce

Function: Word Sorter is a simple command line tool to count how many of each
character are in a word or phrase up to 100 characters long.

Why: I wanted to decrease the amount of time it took to figure out how many
letters I needed to cut out of construction paper for my decorations as an RA.
